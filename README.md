  My personal blog based on <a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank">Lumen</a>, A minimal, lightweight and mobile-first starter for creating blogs uses <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>.

## Quick Start

#### Install required dependencies

Install gatsby CLI

```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli

# OR

yarn global add gatsby-cli
```
Install the dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

#### Start Developing

Navigate into the siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```sh
yarn develop
```

#### Open the source code and start editing!

The blog is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

It also runs a `netlify-cms` server on localhost which can be used to CRUD the content of this blog.

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Open the `blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/templates/index-template.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
