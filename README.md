## Quick Start

#### Install required dependencies

Install gatsby CLI

```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli

# OR

yarn global add gatsby-cli
```
Install the dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

#### Start Developing

Navigate into the site’s directory and start it up.

```sh
yarn develop
```

#### Open the source code and start editing!

The blog is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

It also runs a `netlify-cms` server on localhost which can be used to CRUD the content of this blog.

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Open the `blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/templates/index-template.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Deploy with Netlify

[Netlify](https://netlify.com) CMS can run in any frontend web environment, but the quickest way to try it out is by running it on a pre-configured starter site with Netlify. Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of Lumen:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

After clicking that button, you’ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete. Next, you’ll need to set up Netlify’s Identity service to authorize users to log in to the CMS.
