Experienced Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industry. Highly skilled in Performance Testing, Test Automation with tools like JMeter, Selenium, and LoadRunner. I hack HTTP protocol between any client and server to emulate huge volumes of production to verify/certify an application. I write Groovy, Python or JS to fulfill my day to day automation job.

Well, that's my day job. However, what I am also passionate about is web technologies around Modern JavaScript, React, Graphql, Redux, nodejs etc. and Python. 

For my tech-detox, I do enjoy travelling to various national parks, camping, hiking and other outdoor activities. Music of Dire Straits, Queen, AC/DC, Coldplay, John Mayer etc. keeps me going.
