I am a JavaScript developer. I indulge myself to the quirky weird behaviors of JS everyday. I enjoy the changes that it is going through and adapt myself to the newer capabilities that it offers. I like all things web development and it includes Reactjs, Vuejs, Graphql and a whole lot of backend Nodejs libraries. Such a great platform to connect and be creative!

For my tech-detox, I do enjoy travelling to various national parks, camping, hiking and other outdoor activities. Music of Dire Straits, Queen, AC/DC, Coldplay, John Mayer etc. keeps me going.
