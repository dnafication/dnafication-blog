[Fiddler][1] is a great tool if you are a web application developer or a performance or automation tester. It allows you to record, inspect, modify and generate HTTP traffic between clients (eg. a web browser or mobile app) and servers. It is installed on your desktop and it can help you setup a proxy server which can listen to the communication between apps running on you system and server.

## Setup
Download and install fiddler by visiting [this link][2]. It is currently in beta for OSX & linux at the time of writing this blog. Works great for Windows though. The example shown below are mostly from Windows perspective but it will work for other platforms the same way.

## Getting started
Assuming you have installed Fiddler, start it up by launching the app from start menu. 

![here is how it looks][3]

Go to the Tools > Options > HTTPS 

![Fiddler options https][4]

Tick the checkbox for Decrypt HTTPs traffic which will require you to trust fiddler generated certificate as a root certificate. Also, click the actions and trust 

![fiddler > actions > trust root certificate][5] 

Another interesting tab in options is connection. It clearly explains which port is used by fiddler to setup the proxy server. Using that you can manually setup the client or if you are following the instructions above, you are ready to start capturing.

![fiddler > options > connections][6] 

Now, if you open your web browser, say chrome and go to `https://www.google.com.au/` you should see something like below in fiddler. If for some reason, it doesn't appear at this point, follow [this guide.][7]

![fiddler capturing][8]

1. Session List - you need to click/select a session to view its details
2. Inspector view - has details about the session
3. Request view - related to client request
4. Response view - related to server response

Let's focus on request and response object views. What I have selected in the figure below is __Raw tab__ which basically contains all the information about them. All the other tabs are just different way of presenting the same information. Like __Headers tab__ is more focussed on request or response headers and displays them in tree view. __TextView__ and __SyntaxView__ displays the request/response body.

![request and response](//images.ctfassets.net/yvcmf0lc3wc3/7LU2nIZMpLfXkYeAAKrFId/04ba918d20bd17e6d07a0c2a7fdd1a64/image.png)

### Request

Request is sent by the client like mobile app, web browser etc. It usually consists of the `method` (or `verb`), the `url` or `path` of the resource, the protocol `version`, `headers` and optionally request body.

![http request](//images.ctfassets.net/yvcmf0lc3wc3/47GAmW6tTl0CtJpmT8jtaq/91d341c3490c4c65a3af4238546d68b6/image.png)

``` http
GET https://www.google.com.au/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com.au
Connection: keep-alive
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Chrome/75.0.3770.80 Mobile Safari/537.36
DNT: 1
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en,en-GB;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8
Cookie: SID=ZweS0XMsl21q-
```

Its clear from above that http messages are human readable but it is not necessary. Any backend developer could interpret these variables sent through the http request and process the message accordingly. 

### Response

Response object usually contains `protocol`, `status code`, `status message`, `headers` and optionally a `body`.

## Quick & dirty tips
Some handy short cuts I use daily.

1. Right click on any session object you want to filter and select __Filter Now__ to show to hide certain types of sessions. ![Filter Now](https://i.imgur.com/BQ9nOW7.png)

2. Right click and select __Comment__ to add additional information to the session. or hit __m__ on your keyboard. ![add comments in fiddler](https://i.imgur.com/aypSrbs.png)

3. Click Rules on the menu and check __Hide Image Requests__ if don't want to see image related requests in your session list. ![Hide image request](https://i.imgur.com/KNLazvn.png)

4. For your easy viewing of sessions which are generally compressed and encoded, you may want to click __Decode__ on the shorcuts menubar. ![Shortcuts](https://i.imgur.com/mMUNq70.png)

5. There is a command bar below the sessions list, which is called __QuickExec__. For example typing `@hackmd` and pressing enter will only select sessions which has `hackmd` in the their hostname. [Read more here.](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/knowledgebase/quickexec) ![search hackmd in quickexec in fiddler](https://i.imgur.com/INDVmWT.png) QuickExec allows you to select sessions based on different search criteria such as text, size, status, method etc.

6. __Shift + Del__ will delete the inverse selection.

7. __Ctrl + X__ removes all sessions from the list. Be careful!

8. __F12__ toggles capture of traffic.

9. User __TextWizard__ to do string manipulations or inspect the text request/response ![TextWizard](https://i.imgur.com/4cj2ZR0.png)

### Summary
With a tool like fiddler, you can visualize and do a lot more with these captured traffic. It allows you to save these captured data in an archive file with `.saz` extension and view or edit them in future. I find the interface very convenient in my day to day use.
